# Protecting (and breaking) computers and networks!

## Who am I?
My name is Devon and I am currently in my Junior year at Western Governors University where I study Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I hold an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Forensics and Associate of Arts in Liberal Arts. Currently, I am working towards the CompTIA Network+ CE certification. As of December 1st, 2023, I have obtained the CompTIA A+ CE certification!<br>
I have interests in digital/computer forensics, the cloud, malware development and analysis, threat hunting and research, threat intelligence, cybersecurity defense, and cyber physical systems (smart grid, smart transportation, and medical devices).<br>

You'll see me compete in CTFs and Hackathons under the usernames `SirBiffles` and `Sir_Biffles_Protects` with the team `SpaceCats`!<br>
